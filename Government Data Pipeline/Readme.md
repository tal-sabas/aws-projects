# Government Data Project
 This project's purpose is to gather a variety of public data sources available by the US government, and store the data in a way that can be used for deeper insights and analysis.
 This project provides a mechanism to combine multiple public data sources, easier querying of the data, and gives flexibility to build AI or reporting on top of the sources.
 This is a 100% AWS-based product, with the exception of Tableau.
