# Overview
This repository contains architecture diagrams for various projects I've worked on in AWS. This is just a sample of the projects I've worked on, and does not encompass all of the services I've used in AWS.
These projects span multiple companies, each with its own unique environment and set of expectations. Some were in early stage startups and others were at larger enterprise companies.
